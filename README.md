# BLINK & MISS
## Basic Details
### Team Name: APPLE

### Project Description  
A fun LED matrix paddle game where you catch a falling ball using buttons to move a paddle. Controls invert every 10 seconds, dance mode triggers randomly, and a Super Mario tune plays on misses.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
How do you make a simple LED game more exciting and challenging with control inversion, dance mode, and cool buzzer tunes?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We made an LED paddle catch game with random dance moves, inverted controls, and a Super Mario melody that plays every time you miss the ball.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:  
- Arduino IDE  
- C++  

For Hardware:  
- ESP32 or Arduino compatible board  
- 5x5 LED matrix wired with 5 row pins and 5 column pins  
- 3 push buttons (Left, Right, Reset)  
- Buzzer (active buzzer recommended)  
- Jumper wires and breadboard  

### Implementation

For Software:

#### Installation  
- Install Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
- Install board support for your microcontroller (e.g. ESP32)  
- Download and open `BLINK & MISS.ino` in Arduino IDE  

#### Run  
- Connect the hardware as per pin assignments in code  
- Upload the sketch to the board  
- Press Left/Right buttons to move paddle and catch falling ball  
- Press Reset button to restart the game after missing
